This growing interest is mainly because of the increasing popularity of the Oceanus Folk genre, which started on the island and became globally known through its local superstar, Sailor Shift.\n\nSailor began her music career in 2023 as part of the Oceanus Folk band *Ivy Echoes*. After the group disbanded in 2026, she found solo success in 2028. Her viral single not only hit the top of global charts—becoming the first Oceanus Folk song to do so—but also pushed her into the spotlight as an international star.\n\nSince then, Sailor has released a new album nearly every year, each one doing better than the last. Even though she’s explored other genres like Indie Pop and Indie Folk through collaborations, she always circles back to her Oceanus Folk roots. This genre’s global reach keeps growing, and a big part of that is thanks to Sailor's work. Her collaborations stand out because she stays focused on two things:\n\n1.  Sharing and promoting Oceanus Folk.\n\n2.  Helping new artists grow.\n\nAside from her own career, Sailor’s success also brought attention to her former *Ivy Echoes* bandmates. All of them are still active in the music scene. Together, they’ve helped grow Oceanus Folk’s influence and opened the door for a new wave of rising artists in the genre.\n\n### **1.2 Task**\n\nFor these 2025 VAST Challenge (MC1), this project aims to support local journalist Silas Reed in crafting a piece titled \"Oceanus Folk: Then-and-Now.\" This article will chronicle the ascent of Sailor Shift and the pervasive influence of Oceanus Folk within the music industry. To achieve this, we're leveraging a comprehensive dataset that includes musical artists, producers, albums, songs, and their intricate influence networks, all organized as a knowledge graph.\n\nOur goal is to transform this rich data into insightful visualizations, revealing new and compelling information about Sailor's journey to stardom and the broader impact of Oceanus Folk on the music world which summarized in 3 questions:\n\n1.  Was the influence intermittent (not continuous, not stable, occurring at irregular intervals) ?\n2.  What genre and top artist have been most influenced by Oceanus Folk?\n3.  How has Oceanus Folk changed with the rise of Sailor Shift? From which genre does it draw most of its contemporary inspiration?\n\n## 2 Data Preparation\n\n### 2.1 Package Installation\n\nWe start by loading the required R packages using the `pacman::p_load()` function. Each package serves a specific purpose for our analysis:\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Code\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(\n  jsonlite,     # for reading JSON files\n  tidyverse,    # includes dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, stringr, etc.\n  lubridate,    # for date handling\n  patchwork,    # for combining ggplots\n  ggraph,       # for graph visualizations\n  tidygraph,    # for working with tidy network data\n  igraph,       # backend graph structure\n  visNetwork,   # for interactive network graphs\n  kableExtra,    # for enhanced table formatting (if used in reporting)\n  shiny\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n### 2.2 Loading Data\n\nIn this step, we load the data from the **VAST Challenge 2025 – Mini Challenge 1** dataset.\n\nThis dataset contains:\n\n-   **17,412 nodes**\n\n-   **37,857 edges**\n\nThe datas represent musical entities such as **artists**, **songs**, **albums**, **music groups**, and **genres**. which also include the the edges that describe relationships like **collaborations** and **influences**.\n\nAdditionally we will also explore the data structure to .....\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## Code\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# Load Data\ndata <- fromJSON(\"~/Documents/SMU/April Term 2/Visual Analytics/patriciatrisno/ISSS608-VAA/VAST Challenge 2025/MC1/MC1_graph.json\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Data Structure\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr(data, max.level = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nList of 5\n $ directed  : logi TRUE\n $ multigraph: logi TRUE\n $ graph     :List of 2\n $ nodes     :'data.frame':\t17412 obs. of  10 variables:\n $ links     :'data.frame':\t37857 obs. of  4 variables:\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\nThe data includes:\n\n-   Node types: `Person`, `Song`, `RecordLabel`, `Album`, `MusicalGroup`\n\n-   Edge types: `MemberOf`, `PerformerOf`, `ComposerOf`, `ProducerOf`, `LyricistOf`, `InStyleOf`, `InterpolatesFrom`, `CoverOf`, `LyricalReferenceTo`, `DirectlySamples`, `RecordedBy`, `DistributedBy`\n\n### 2.3 Extract Edges and Nodes Tables\n\nWe convert the JSON data into data frames for easier analysis and transformation.\n\nThis step helps us **organize the data for analysis**, such as filtering, labeling, and visualizing relationships.

It allows us to clearly define what each node and edge represents in the graph.\n\nWe group similar edge types into broader categories for clearer analysis:\n\n-   **Creator Of**: edges like PerformerOf, ComposerOf, ProducerOf, LyricistOf, etc.\n\n-   **Influenced By**: edges like InterpolatesFrom, InStyleOf, CoverOf, etc.\n\n-   **Member Of**: edges that indicate group memberships\n\nWe also label nodes by type and genre.

The Oceanus Folk genre appears clustered, indicating that its influence tends to stay within specific genre circles. Sailor Shift’s direct impact seems to be more focused on albums than individual artists. Yellow nodes, representing Oceanus Folk works, are clearly concentrated in certain areas of the network.\n\nIn contrast, Ivy Echos—as a group—shows greater influence over musical groups rather than individual artists, some of whom are also known to have been influenced by Sailor Shift. Compared to Sailor, Ivy Echos’ direct connections demonstrate stronger influence over artists who actively produce works within the Oceanus Folk genre.\n:::\n\nAs we delve deeper into the network, several important questions begin to emerge: How did these influences evolve over time? What shifts occurred in the structure and spread of Oceanus Folk? And more importantly, which individuals or groups were most significantly shaped by the genre?\n\nUnderstanding these aspects is essential to grasp not only the **temporal dynamics** of influence—such as whether it surged in particular years or plateaued—but also to uncover the **pathways through which Oceanus Folk expanded** its reach. This includes examining whether its growth was driven more by key individuals like Sailor Shift or collaborative collectives like Ivy Echos, and how these actors shaped the genre’s identity.\n\nTo systematically explore these dimensions, we will structure our analysis around the following three core questions:\n\n1.  **How has influence changed over time?**\n\n2.  **What structural changes occurred in the influence network?**\n\n3.  **Who are the most impacted individuals or groups within the network?**\n\nThis three-part focus will help reveal not just the presence of influence, but its *depth, direction, and development over time*.\n\n## 6 **Was the influence of Oceanus Folk intermittent or did it have a gradual rise?**\n\nIn this part we will incorporate ggplot2 to better show the trends in\n\n### 6.1 Visualizing Trend of Oceanus Folk by their Number of Release Overtime\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n![](images/img%201.png)\n\n**Insights**\n\nThis graph shows the number of songs and albums released under the Oceanus Folk genre over time. We observe that in 2023, there is a significant peak with 34 releases, the highest across all years.\n\nOverall, the trend after 2023 appears to be higher than before 2023, though the difference is not dramatically large. However, it is evident that the release numbers fluctuate from year to year, indicating an unstable pattern. For instance, while 2023 saw the highest release count, other years like 2021, 2018, and 2014 also showed relatively high activity, but there are also years with minimal or no releases.\n\n### 6.2 Visualizing the Popularity of Oceanus Folk Genre\n\nTo understand it's popularity we can also take a look at number of artist or musical group that adopt Oceanus Folk song. Here we consider artist that perform, compose and covering the song with Oceanus Folk genre\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n![](images/img%202.png)\n\n**Insights**\n\nThe overall trend indicates that artist adoption of the Oceanus Folk genre began to grow steadily from the 2010s, reaching its peak in 2023 before showing signs of decline. The number of cover versions remains relatively low compared to performances of Oceanus Folk works, which may suggest that artists are more engaged in original interpretations rather than reinterpreting existing pieces.\n\nWhile the number of composers contributing to Oceanus Folk was slightly higher between the 2010s and 2026, the difference is not particularly substantial.\n\n## 7 **What genres and top artists have been most influenced by Oceanus Folk?**\n\n### 7.1 Visualizing Top Genres that have been most influenced by Oceanus Folk\n\n#### 7.1.1 Overview of songs network\n\nThis network visualization aims to explore how Oceanus Folk has influenced other songs and genres through direct and indirect musical connections.

At the heart of this transformation is Sailor Shift, whose solo career and foundational role in *Ivy Echos* catalyzed the rise of Oceanus Folk. Through network visualizations, we reveal how Sailor’s influence spread across songs, artists, and albums, with her impact especially strong on album production within the genre. Ivy Echos also played a pivotal role, fostering genre continuity and nurturing talent. Together, they helped Oceanus Folk grow—not just in popularity, but in structural depth, as shown by the genre's extensive and recurring creative connections in recent years.\n\nThe genre’s influence has been both widespread and dynamic. Notably, genres like Indie Folk, Dream Pop, Doom Metal, and Synthwave have increasingly shaped the newer sound of Oceanus Folk since 2023, reflecting a shift toward atmospheric and emotionally layered expressions. While the genre continues to evolve internally—frequently influencing itself through stylistic borrowing—our visual and temporal analyses show a clear expansion of Oceanus Folk’s reach. This insight is vital for readers to understand not just *who* influenced and was influenced by the genre, but *how* it developed over time, across styles, and through different generations of artists.\n",
