### About Me ðŸŽ€

I'm an Analytics student in the MITB January Intake. Maybe I don't have as much experience as some others, but I don't think that's a bad thing. I see it as a chance to learn new things. It might not be easy to make the most of this chance, but I believe that staying strong and positive will help me achieve good things.
